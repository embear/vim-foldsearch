After (make sure foldsearch is ended):
  call foldsearch#foldsearch#FoldEnd()

Execute (fold a pattern with highlighting):
  let g:foldsearch_highlight = 1
  call foldsearch#foldsearch#FoldPattern("bar")

Then (check that pattern is part of matches):
  let found = 0
  for match in getmatches()
    if match.pattern =~# '\<bar$' && match.group == 'Search'
      let found = 1
    endif
  endfor
  Assert found == 1
  redraw " clear 'echo' messages by forced redraw

Execute (fold a pattern without highlighting):
  let g:foldsearch_highlight = 0
  call foldsearch#foldsearch#FoldPattern("bar")

Then (check that pattern is not part of matches):
  let found = 0
  for match in getmatches()
    if match.pattern =~# '\<bar$' && match.group == 'Search'
      let found = 1
    endif
  endfor
  Assert found == 0
