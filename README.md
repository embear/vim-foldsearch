# Foldsearch

This plugin provides commands that fold away lines that don't match a specific
search pattern. This pattern can be the word under the cursor, the last search
pattern, a regular expression or spelling errors. There are also commands to
change the context of the shown lines.

The plugin can be found on [GitHub] and [VIM online].

## Commands

### The `:Fw` command

Show lines which contain the word under the cursor.

The optional *context* option consists of one or two numbers:

  - A 'unsigned' number defines the context before and after the pattern.
  - If a number has a '-' prefix, it defines only the context before the pattern.
  - If it has a '+' prefix, it defines only the context after a pattern.

Default *context* is current context.

### The `:Fs` command

Show lines which contain previous search pattern.

For a description of the optional *context* please see |:Fw|

Default *context* is current context.

### The `:Fp` command

Show the lines that contain the given regular expression.

Please see |regular-expression| for patterns that are accepted.

### The `:FS` command

Show the lines that contain spelling errors.

### The `:Fl` command

Fold again with the last used pattern

### The `:Fc` command

Show or modify current *context* lines around matching pattern.

For a description of the optional *context* option please see |:Fw|

### The `:Fi` command

Increment *context* by one line.

### The `:Fd` command

Decrement *context* by one line.

### The `:Fe` command

Set modified fold options to their previous value and end foldsearch.

## Mappings

  - `<Leader>fw` : `:Fw` with current context
  - `<Leader>fs` : `:Fs` with current context
  - `<Leader>fS` : `:FS`
  - `<Leader>fl` : `:Fl`
  - `<Leader>fi` : `:Fi`
  - `<Leader>fd` : `:Fd`
  - `<Leader>fe` : `:Fe`

Mappings can be disabled by setting |g:foldsearch_disable_mappings| to 1

## Settings

Use: `let g:option_name=option_value` to set them in your global vimrc.

### The `g:foldsearch_highlight` setting

Highlight the pattern used for folding.

  - Value `0`: Don't highlight pattern
  - Value `1`: Highlight pattern
  - Default: `0`

### The `g:foldsearch_disable_mappings` setting

Disable the mappings. Use this to define your own mappings or to use the
plugin via commands only.

  - Value `0`: Don't disable mappings (use mappings)
  - Value `1`: Disable Mappings
  - Default: `0`

### The `g:foldsearch_scope` setting

Scope for which pattern, display context, original view etc. are stored.
If `window` is used, then different types of foldsearch can be done for the
same buffer displayed in several windows. if `buffer? is used, then different
types of foldsearch can be done for several buffers displayed in the same
window.

  - Value `window`: Use window scope to store data
  - Value `buffer`: Use buffer scope to store data
  - Default: `window`
